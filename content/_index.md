# Hi there!

![A picture of me](img/me.jpg)

My name is Geri Skenderi and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, working under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Cristani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LbgTPRwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Currently, I am a visiting scholar at the DSE Lab of Michigan State University, headed by [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WtzKMWAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My research interests cover the broad area of deep representation learning, in particular disentangled representation learning and graph representation learning. I am also an avid enjoyer and reader of mathematics. For more professional information, feel free to read my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b4r9517qMyL203TUu9hNuyu6bGFb1tQF/view?usp=sharing).

On a personal note, I love listening to and making music, working out, playing video-games, and watching anime. 

If you are interested in my research or you wish to discuss something, you can find all of my contact information below.
