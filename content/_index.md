# Oh, hi!

![A picture of me](img/me.jpg)

My name is Geri Skenderi and I am a PhD Student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, working under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Cristani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LbgTPRwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am currently a visiting student at the DSE Lab, headed by [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WtzKMWAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at Michigan State University.

My research interests cover the broad area of deep representation learning, in particular disentangled representation learning and graph representation learning. I am also an avid enjoyer and reader of mathematics. For more professional information, you can download or read my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/188yow9H1AET8P-HobNpRl1q2tXw8odlz/view?usp=sharing).

On a personal note, I love listening to and making music, doing physical activity, playing video-games, and watching anime. 

If you are interested in my research or you wish to discuss various matters, you can find all of my contact information below.
