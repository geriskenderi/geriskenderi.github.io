# Hi there!

![A picture of me](img/me.jpg)

My name is Geri Skenderi, and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics. My current research lies in the intersection of Physics (Statistical Mechanics), Computer Science (Algorithms), and AI (Neural Networks), with the goal of understanding the limitations of modern Neural Networks. I maintain an active interest in the field of (Deep) Representation Learning, particularly in Graph Representation Learning and Disentangled Representation Learning. For more professional information feel free to read my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o75sZVCm6zOEnq8AKA01B72VLplrpLSw/view?usp=sharing).

I did my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Verona under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Cristani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LbgTPRwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and I also had the privilege of being a visiting scholar at the DSE Lab of Michigan State University, headed by [Prof. Jiliang Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WtzKMWAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

On a personal note, I love listening to and making music, working out, and watching anime. If you are interested in my research or wish to talk about something, you can find all of my contact information below.
